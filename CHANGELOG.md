# 0.2.0.0

* Descriptions of shortcuts look much better now.
* “sublime” was renamed to “sublimepc”, since it's possible that some other package manager for Sublime Text would emerge in the future.
* Shortcut “tvt” for TV Tropes was removed – it's just “tvtropes” now.
* “facebook” can link to profiles by their ID.
* “tvtropes” properly capitalises names of categories (if given as an option) – previously you needed to write e.g. “SugarWiki”, now “sugar wiki” works too.
